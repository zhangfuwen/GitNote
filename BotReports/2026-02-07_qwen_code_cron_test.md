# Qwen Code Cron Job Test Report

## Status
- **Date**: 2026-02-07
- **Test Type**: Cron Job Integration
- **Result**: Partial Success

## Findings

### ✅ What Worked
1. **Cron Job Updates**: Successfully updated all coding-related cron jobs to reference qwen-code specifically
2. **BotReports Integration**: Created proper directory structure for automated reporting
3. **GitHub Pages**: Confirmed reports will be automatically published as HTML

### ⚠️ Authentication Issue
- **Problem**: qwen-code requires authentication configuration
- **Current State**: No `.qwen/settings.json` or environment variables found
- **Impact**: qwen-code cannot make API calls without proper auth

### 🔧 Recommended Fix
To enable qwen-code functionality, please configure authentication by either:

**Option 1: Environment Variables**
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://api.openai.com/v1"  # optional
```

**Option 2: Qwen Settings File**
Create `/root/.qwen/settings.json`:
```json
{
  "openai": {
    "apiKey": "your-api-key",
    "baseUrl": "https://api.openai.com/v1"
  }
}
```

**Option 3: Use Your Existing Nanobot Config**
Since you have OpenRouter configured in nanobot, you can use the same key:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-or-v1-your-openrouter-key"
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"
```

## Next Steps

1. **Configure Authentication**: Set up qwen-code authentication as described above
2. **Test Integration**: Once auth is configured, qwen-code will work in cron jobs
3. **Monitor Reports**: All future code reviews will appear in BotReports automatically

## Cron Jobs Updated

- ✅ `morning-code-review` - Now references qwen-code
- ✅ `afternoon-feature-development` - Now references qwen-code  
- ✅ `evening-refactoring` - Now references qwen-code

## Manual Fallback

Until qwen-code authentication is configured, the system will:
- Perform manual code analysis using built-in capabilities
- Create comprehensive reports in the BotReports directory
- Push reports to GitHub for automatic HTML publishing

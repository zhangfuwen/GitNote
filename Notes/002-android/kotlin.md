# how to use a Compose View and pass it as an argument of android's traditional addView

If you want to use a Compose View and pass it as an argument to the traditional `addView` method in Android, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a Compose View using the `AndroidView` composable function. This function allows you to embed an Android View inside a Compose UI hierarchy.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun MyComposeView() {
    AndroidView(factory = { context ->
        // Create and return your custom Android View
        MyCustomView(context).apply {
            // Set any necessary properties or listeners
        }
    })
}
```

In the above example, `MyCustomView` is an Android View that you want to embed in a Compose UI.

2. In your traditional Android code, locate the parent view where you want to add the Compose View.

```kotlin
val parentView = findViewById<ViewGroup>(R.id.parentView)
```

3. Create an instance of the `composable` function by wrapping your Compose View.

```kotlin
val myComposeView = @Composable { MyComposeView() }
```

4. Inflate the Compose View using the `setContent` function and add it to the parent view using the `addView` method.

```kotlin
ViewCompositionStrategy.DisposeOnViewTreeLifecycleDestroyed.on(parentView).apply {
    setContent {
        myComposeView()
    }
}
```

In the above code, `ViewCompositionStrategy.DisposeOnViewTreeLifecycleDestroyed` makes sure that the Compose View is properly disposed of when the view tree is destroyed.

5. If needed, you can update the Compose View by recomposing it with new data.

```kotlin
myComposeView.invalidate()
```

This step is optional and should be used if you want to update the Compose View dynamically.

By following these steps, you can create a Compose View and pass it as an argument to the `addView` method in traditional Android development.
